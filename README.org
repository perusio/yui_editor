* YUI Editor module for Drupal

** Description

This module provides the [[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/][YUI Rich Text Editor]] from the [[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui][YUI]] (Yahoo!
User Interface) library. 

It requires the [[http://drupal.org/project/yui][YUI]] module from drupal.org in order to be installed.

This is a modified version of the [[http://drupal.org/project/yui_editor][YUI editor]] that supports paste from
Microsoft Word and alikes. 

It uses the [[http://richtextcleanpaste.codeplex.com][Rich Text Clean Paste]] plugin.

** Why aren't you using WYSIWYG?

Well in the past I've tried it and couldn't get ot to work with YUI
editor. It's IMHO the best looking RTE out there, furthermore the
advanced configuration provided, like profiles, toolbar customization
and such are quite nice. So due to my not very positive impressions of
YUI with WYSIWIYG I've settled for this module.
